To enable USB serial gadget mode on your Pi Zero 2 W, while keeping HDMI and keyboard working, starting from "known-good setup (fresh or existing card)":

---

### 1. Edit the Correct Files on the SD Card (or on the Pi)

**a. `/boot/firmware/config.txt`**  
Add (or ensure you have) this line anywhere (preferably near the end):
```
dtoverlay=dwc2
```

**b. `/boot/firmware/cmdline.txt`**  
On the single line, append (after `rootwait` and before `console=tty1`):
```
modules-load=dwc2,g_serial
```
Example:
```
... rootwait modules-load=dwc2,g_serial console=tty1
```
(Do not add line breaks.)

---

### 2. Boot the Pi with HDMI and Keyboard Connected

- Insert the SD card, power up, and log in as usual.

---

### 3. Enable the Getty on the Gadget Port

On the Pi, run:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now serial-getty@ttyGS0.service
```
This will ensure a login prompt appears on the USB serial gadget.

---

### 4. Verify the Setup

On the Pi, check:
```bash
ls -l /dev/ttyGS0
lsmod | grep -E 'dwc2|g_serial'
systemctl status serial-getty@ttyGS0.service
```
Should see `/dev/ttyGS0`, both modules loaded, and the getty service active.

---

### 5. Connect the Pi to Your Windows Laptop & Zimaboard

- Use a data-capable micro-USB cable from the Pi’s “USB” port (not “PWR IN”) to laptop
- In Windows Device Manager, you should see “USB Serial Device (COMx)”.
- Do the same with the zimaboard

---

### 6. Open a Serial Terminal on Windows

- Use PuTTY or TeraTerm.
- Connect to the correct COM port at 115200 baud.
- Press Enter a few times, should then see the Pi’s login prompt.

---

**Should now have both HDMI/keyboard and USB serial gadget login working.**  
Troubleshooting: check the debug steps in the notes (especially enabling getty & checking for `/dev/ttyGS0`).
